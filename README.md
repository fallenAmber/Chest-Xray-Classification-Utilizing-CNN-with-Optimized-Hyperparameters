# Chest-Xray-Classification-Utilizing-CNN-with-Optimized-Hyperparameters
This study presents a deep learning algorithm developed from the ground up to categorize as well as confirm the existence of COVID in a set of X-ray imaging data. Designed a CNN architecture from the ground up to retrieve elements from provided X-ray data to categorize them and identify the individual contaminated with COVID.

Dataset Description
The following public datasets were used in this study:

(1) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database

(2) https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/9xkhgts2s6

(3) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data

The first Database is used to compile chest X-rays of COVID-19 positive pictures and normal images. Images of bacterial pneumonia are sourced from the second Dataset. Furthermore, photos of pneumothorax are obtained from the third Dataset.

Preprocessing & Augmentation:

-Resized all pictures to 224 Ã— 224 pixels,


-Used the min-max normalization method to rescale all pixel values [0, 1],

-Employed photo augmentation for solving the issue of a short dataset and to improve the accuracy rate while limiting model overfitting.

### Conclusion

Demonstrated how to use chest imaging to classify COVID and other lung-related illnesses. Developed this architecture from scratch and distinguished it from different approaches. This study will improve the health of at-risk individuals in the polluted area primarily affected by lung diseases. It will help the medical sector determine the conditions by analyzing the affected area of the chest x-ray.
